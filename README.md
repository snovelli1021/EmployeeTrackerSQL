PLEASE SEE THE SCREENSHOT BELOW:
Halfway through the assignment I noticed I didn't put my db name and password as environmental variables and had already made commits to GitHub. I since deleted the repo and added the files into a new one, the screenshot shows the previous commit history from my old repo.
